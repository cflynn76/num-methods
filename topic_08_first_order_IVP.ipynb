    "Differential equations relate one or more functions and their derivatives. Most physical laws in engineering are expressed in terms of differential equations, e.g. Navier-Stokes equations in fluid mechanics and Fourier's Law in heat transfer.\n",
    "In this section, we are going to focus on ordinary differential equations. An ordinary differential equation contains a function that is dependent on one variable. In particular, we are going to focus on first-order ordinary differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## First-order ordinary differential equations\n",
    "We are going to solve equations of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dt}=f(t,y) \\text{ for } a <=t<=b$$\n",
    " \n",
    "subject to an initial condition\n",
    "$$y(a)=y_o$$\n",
    " \n",
    "Such problems are known as initial-value problems (IVPs).\n",
    "\n",
    "The method we are going to use to solve equations like the above is called Euler's method. It is the easist method for solving these equations.\n",

    "\n",
    "The error depends on the curvature of the function $y$ and the stepsize $h$. Reducing the step size reduces the error.\n",

    "## Exercise\n",
    "Write a Python script to solve the following initial value problem using the Euler method.\n",

    "Calculate the error between the approximate solution and exact solution at each step. Output the results in a table.\n",

    "Plot the approximate and exact solutions on the same figure.\n",

    "A spherical water tank has a radius   m and is emptied through a circular hole of radius   m at the bottom. The top of the tank is open to the atmosphere. The instantaneous water level   in the tank can be determined by the following first order differential equation.\n",
