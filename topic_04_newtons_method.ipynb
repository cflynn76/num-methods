    "For the above function, the roots $x=2$ and $x=3$ can be found analytically. However for many situations, the roots of an equation cannot be determined analytically so numerical methods for estimating them have been developed. Newton's method is one such approach. Newton's method is frequently used in a variety engineering applications. These would include optimising processes to find the best operating parameters or determining the material parameters that describe the mechanical behaviour of complex material.\n",
