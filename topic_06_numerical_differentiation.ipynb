    "In engineering, we frequently want to know the rate of change of a quantity with respect to time, or distance, or other quantity. For example, velocity is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time. Differentiation is determining the rate of change of a quantity. \n",
    "For relatively straightforward equations, we can determine the exact derivative of the quantity - you did this when doing the Newton's method problems. It is common that the exact derivative is not possible to find. Examples would include when there is no equation describing the behaviour of the quantity in question - it may be in the form of an experimental data set. In those cases, numerical differentiation is used to find an approximation to the derivative. We will examine several methods for estimating the first derivative and one method for estimating the second derivative.\n",
