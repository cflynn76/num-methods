    "Solving definite integrals is commonplace in engineering. For example, integrating the pressure that is distributed across a surface determines the force acting. This allows us to determine hydrostatic forces on a dam, for example. Integrating a varying force acting on an object as it moves allows us to calculate the work done. \n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, the exact solution of the definite integrals is not possible to determine. In these cases, we can numerically integrate. There are many different methods of numerical integration. We are going to focus on two methods of numerical integration: the mid-point method and the Simpson's 1/3 Rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mid-point method\n",
    "This method subdivides the interval of integration into equal number of sub interval rectangles. Each sub interval approximates the function and the midpoint of each rectangle. The area of the interval is simply the sum of the areas of all the sub intervals (rectangles). The area of each sub interval is the product of approximate function by the width of the sub interval. \n",

    "where $h=\\frac{b-a}{n}$ is the interval size and $x_j^{*}=\\frac{x_{j-1}+x_j}{2}$.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Simpson's 1/3 method\n",
    "In this method, the interval is sub-divided into sub-intervals of width $h$. For two consecutive sub-intervals, a quadratic polynomial $P(x)$ (the red line below) is used to approximate the function $f(x)$ (in blue below).\n",
